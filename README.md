## Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. Unlike a traditional forward proxy, which sits between the client and the origin server, a reverse proxy sits in front of one or more servers and acts as a gateway for incoming client requests.

Key features of a reverse proxy include:

1. Load Balancing: A reverse proxy can distribute client requests across multiple backend servers, helping to evenly distribute the workload and improve overall performance and reliability.

2. SSL Termination: It can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading this process from the backend servers to improve performance and simplify server configuration.

3. Caching: A reverse proxy can cache static content and serve it directly to clients, reducing the load on backend servers and improving response times for frequently accessed resources.

4. Security: It can provide an additional layer of security by hiding the backend servers from direct access and filtering incoming requests to prevent malicious traffic.

To resolve the data transmission between the backend server and the client, the reverse proxy typically acts as an intermediary. When a client sends a request to the reverse proxy, the reverse proxy establishes a separate connection to the backend server and forwards the request. Once the backend server processes the request and generates a response, the reverse proxy receives the response and forwards it back to the original client.

This process involves managing and maintaining connections between the reverse proxy, backend servers, and clients, as well as handling data transmission in both directions. The reverse proxy may also need to handle issues such as request routing, content compression, and protocol translation to ensure seamless communication between the client and the backend server.
